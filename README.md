# chi_pauli_calculator

This is a website / javascript that will convert Evans method measurements to chi_Pauli values (as well as DOS values). 

There are a few planned changes / extensions.  I would like to have a "save" button added.  Also, perhaps a selection for each entry (metal, solvent, ligand) that lets us specify values on the fly?  For one-off things?
